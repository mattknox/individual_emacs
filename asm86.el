;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Provides support for Asm86 assembly editing. The features and
;; details are discussed in reasonable detail in the major mode
;; documentation string.
;;
;; Note that some routines will run faster if the code is byte-compiled
;; first. The most noticable function is (asm86-tab-region).
;;
;; Additional features to add (wish-list):
;;  * Better EQU formatting (spacing)
;;  * Macro indenting/formatting
;;  * Label finding - find a label within the buffer (electric?)
;;  * Register report - determine which registers are used (altered)
;;    by an assembly function.

 "v. 0.907

Major mode to aid in indenting, commenting, and other
formatting of Asm86 assembly code. Provides syntax
highlighting, if desired.

Semicolons start comments. Single semicolon is considered
inline comment; double semicolon is conisdered code
comment; triple semicolon is considered header comment.
All indentation and formatting uses spaces.

For complete documenatation, see the information on the Web.

Entry to this mode calls the value of \'asm86-mode-hook\' if
that value is bound and has a non-nil value.

;;; Change Log:
;;
;; 07/09/01 - Initial version.
;; 12/22/01 - Lots of updates. Revised the functional breakdown
;;   to make comment handling more flexible (and easier to change).
;;   Implemented several of the functions on the wish-list.
;; 12/23/01 - Updated documentation strings.
;; 12/30/01 - Updated major mode documentation string, to be more
;;   consistent with the style of other major modes.
;; 01/14/02 - Fixed bug in (asm86-insert-instr-arg-gap), which
;;   occured when current line was the last line of the buffer.
;; 01/26/02 - Added additional comment category, bringing the total
;;   to three: header comments, code comments, and inline comments.
;;   Many small changes to accomodate this new functionality.
;; 01/26/02 - Changed function and file headers to be more easily
;;   customized, requiring only a single string.
;; 02/20/02 - Added version number to documentation string. Changed mode
;;   string from "ASM86" to "Asm86".
;; 04/02/02 - Added font-locking (syntax highlighting). Stopped using
;;   auto-fill-mode automatically.
;; 02/10/04 - Changed nomenclature to "extended" style from "glen" style and
;;   updated the extended style headers.
;; 02/01/07 - Made asm86-author settable from within emacs (added asterisk
;;   to start of description string).
;; 02/01/07 - Added name and date to the file header.
;;

;;; asm86-mode.el ends here
