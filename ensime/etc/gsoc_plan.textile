h2. ENSIME Summer Development Plan

This is the project plan for ENSIME during GSOC 2010. The plan lists high-level goals. Each goal entry must include an implementation note that addresses feasibility. We also include a priority annotion in the MoSCoW system:
M Must have.
S Should have.
C Could have if it doesn't affect other priorities.
W Won't have, but would like for the future.

_Rough_ time estimates are included.

As ENSIME is already a functional project (barely), some of the goals below make reference to improving or completing existing features. As of May 17, 2010, none of the goals below has been completed.



h3. Extract project information (dependencies and source locations) from existing build scripts.
** Overall goal is that ENSIME works 'out of the box' for as many users as possible.
** Handle at least Maven, Ivy and SBT projects. SBT already handles all these.
** Possibly link to SBT libraries for this task.
** Time Estimate: 1 week
** Priority: M

h3. Improvements to Entity Browser
** Show class constructors
** Annotate with 'implicit' for interfaces that are acquired implicitely.
** Keyboard shortcuts for jumping to source or docs in Package Brwoser
** Link type parameters separately
** Time Estimate: 3-4 days
** Priority: C

h3. Fix scaladoc linking to jump to specific method in Scala html docs.
** Priority: W

h3. Improvements to Auto-Completion
** Completion of type names and type constructors.
** Display type signatures in a less crowded way
** Time Estimate: 2 days
** Priority: C

h3. Show implicit parameters for methods in Auto-Completion results
** Priority: C

h3. Incremental Building
** Probably use nsc.interactive.BuildManager
** Depends on completion of #1 
** Duplicates some SBT behaviour, but many folks don't use SBT
** Time Estimate: 1.5 weeks
** Priority: M

h3. 'Problems' buffer and navigation
** List all compilation errors and warnings, hyperlinked to source
** This is separate from the problem highlighting which is already working
** Time Estimate: 2 days
** Priority: M

h3. Provide commands for jumping to next or prev problem
** Priority: C

h3. Embedded Scala REPL
** Depends on completion of #1 
** Use exiting code for running Scala REPL as inferior process
** Time Estimate: 2 days
** Priority: M

h3. SBT integration
** Code already exists for running SBT as an Emacs inferior process
** ENSIME should be able to Automatically start inferior SBT
** Provide key shortcuts for issuing SBT commands
** Time Estimate: 2 days
** Priority: M

h3. Debugging
** Investigate improvement of Emacs GUD mode with respect to Scala
** Challenge will be translation of source names and positions to underlying java classes
** Scala debugging should work as well as Java debugging (in Emacs)
** Time Estimate: 2 weeks
** Priority: M

h3. 'Uses' search
** List all uses of a particular method or type, hyperlinked to source
** Depends on some unknowns in the compiler source..(can we do a global symbol search?)
** Time Estimate: 1 week
** Priority: S

h3. A framework for automated refactorings.
** Should support a basic set of refactorings. At least Rename and Organize Imports.
** Should provide a clear path for adding new refactorings in the future.
** Should provide reassuring user interface for selecting, confirming and reverting these operations.
** Mirko Stocker is working on stand-alone refactorings. ENSIME work should be mostly GUI glue.
** Time Estimate: 1.5 weeks
** Priority: S+

h3. Stability 
** Address issue in compiler back-end where type tree is sometimes not returned
** Should make every effort to return a reasonable answer to user
** Possibly cache last good tree
** Time Estimate: 1 week
** Priority: S

h3. Documentation 
** Improve the installation, startup guide.
** Describe all user configuration options
** Document all Scala and Elisp code and generate API docs for Scala
** Time Estimate: 4 days
** Priority: M
