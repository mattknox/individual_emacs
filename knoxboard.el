;; Twilight Colour Theme for Emacs.
;;
;; Defines a colour scheme resembling that of the original TextMate Twilight colour theme.
;; To use add the following to your .emacs file (requires the color-theme package):
;;
;; (require 'color-theme)
;; (color-theme-initialize)
;; (load-file "~/.emacs.d/twilight-emacs/color-theme-twilight.el")
;;
;; And then (color-theme-twilight) to activate it.
;;
;; Several areas still require improvement such as recognition of code that ruby-mode doesn't
;; yet pick up (eg. parent classes), Rails/Merb keywords, or non Ruby code related areas
;; (eg. dired, HTML, etc). Please feel free to customize further and send in any improvements,
;; patches most welcome.
