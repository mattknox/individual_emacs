;;; uptime.el by David N. Welton <davidw@dedasys.com>

;;; uptime defines 2 user visible functions, `uptime' and
;;; `linux-uptime'. `uptime' works on all systems, but must be
;;; initiliazed with `uptime-init' in your .emacs file.
;;; `linux-uptime' is, as the name suggests, specific to GNU/Linux
;;; systems because of its dependence on the /proc filesystem.

;;; Modified by Trond Endrest√∏l <Trond.Endrestol@fagskolen.gjovik.no>
;;; on Monday 2 June 2008.  I made the code run on FreeBSD 6.2, using
;;; FreeBSD's /proc filesystem and the date command.  The code is
;;; untested with respect to the other *BSDs, such as NetBSD, OpenBSD,
;;; and even BSD/OS.

;;; With my (Trond's) modifications, uptime defines 3 user visible
;;; functions `uptime', `linux-uptime' and `bsd-uptime'.  `bsd-uptime'
;;; is dependant on the BSD /proc filesystem and the date command.

;;; The original variable uptime-stat-file-starttime-position, has
;;; been given its companion, bsd-uptime-stat-file-starttime-position.
